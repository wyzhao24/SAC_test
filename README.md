# SAC-Test: SAC Algorithm Validation on Pendulum-v1
This repository provides a simplified implementation and validation test of the **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** reinforcement learning algorithm, specifically designed for the `Pendulum-v1` environment.

### Background
The core code is adapted from the implementation demonstrated in this Bilibili tutorial video:  
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CKoTY3EdW/?spm_id_from=333.1391.0.0&p=8  

We have modified key code segments to improve the agent's convergence stability and performance on the `Pendulum-v1` task.

### Important Note
To run the code and save experimental/model data properly, you **must create a new directory named `model`** in the project root directory before execution.
